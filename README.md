# Graph Traversal

This was the first assignment for COMP20007 Design of Algorithms at The University of Melbourne, Semester 1 2017.

The assignment was to traverse a [graph](assignment_graph.pdf) using different algorithms to reach a destination. 
This included Depth-First traversal and Breadth-First traversal using Stacks, Linked Lists and Queues. 
More information about the assignment can be found in the [specification](spec.pdf) and the [report](Report.pdf).
